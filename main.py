    The Nobel Prize is a set of prestigious international awards given annually in several categories, recognizing outstanding achievements in various fields. The prizes were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish inventor, scientist, and philanthropist, in 1895. The Prizes are awarded for exceptional contributions in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economic Sciences and were first awarded in the year 1901.
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>
    Analyzing the Nobel laureates data allows us to celebrate and understand the achievements of outstanding individuals and organizations.  The Nobel Prize has a rich history dating back to 1901. Analyzing the data provides insights into historical events, societal changes, and global trends over the years. Examining demographic data among Nobel laureates sheds light on gender and geographical representation, fostering discussions about diversity and inclusivity in various fields.

On an average, the age of Nobel Prize winners has demonstrated an upward trend over the years. While both Physicist and Chemists were making their ground breaking discoveries while they were young since the inception of Nobel Prize awards, where the average age of the recipient was roughly <b> 50 years </b> in the first decade (1901 - 1910) while it has jumped to <b> > 65 </b> for Chemistry and Physics in the last decade (2010 - 2019). 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This could be because a century ago, there were perhaps only 1000s of physicists, compared to an estimated millions of them today. The surge in the overall number of breakthroughs each year might be surpassing the capacity of awards to keep pace with the deserving individuals hence a longer waiting time.

             There is a significant gender disparity and historically majority of the Nobel laureates have been male especially in field of Science (Physics and Chemistry in particularly) and Economics where less than five percent of all winners have been female.

             On a historical context, Nobel prizes were established in the late 19th century when opportunities for women to pursue advanced education and careers in science and academia were very limited.

Nevertheless, exceptions exist, with certain laureates gaining recognition much later in life for enduring contributions or discoveries made over an extended period. Ultimately, age stands as just one factor among many.
