Nobel laureates' data analysis is not just a journey through numbers; it's a thrilling adventure into the hearts and minds of those who dared to dream big and change the world. To fuel my curiosity, I decided to explore the nobel laureates dataset by fetching it usig the developer API offered by [nobelprize.org](https://website-name.com)https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/.
Let the data exploration games begin! 

oh wait! to takes things a bit further I have used **Streamlit**  an open-source Python library that makes it super easy to create interactive web applications and data visualizations. allowing me to turn data scripts into shareable web apps while adding an element of interactivity, customization, and storytelling, making the exploration of this historical and diverse dataset both enjoyable and insightful.
